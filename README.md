## Executive Summary

The objective of this project is to gain a better understanding of the competition between taxis and ride-sharing companies and use the newfound insights to the benefit of both the customers and the drivers as well. Using the city of Chicago's data portal, we acquired the taxi and ridesharing dataset which contains information about trip details, price, and location. From this, we performed singular value decomposition (SVD) as a dimensionality reduction method and then kmedians as a clustering method which yielded a total of four clusters which we each identified as a customer segment.

Segment 1 has the lowest paid fare and tip due to having the shortest trip distance and duration. It is also composed mainly of taxis and is traveling mostly within Near North Side. Segment 2, on the other hand, is situated near South Side with the most frequent route being between Near North Side and the Loop. Coming from Garfield Ridge, which is a small community, is Segment 3 which has the highest ratio of TNPs. And finally, we have Segment 4, which has the highest paid fare and tip with the longest trip distance and duration. However, the travel pattern observed for this segment is quite erratic which made us conclude that customers from this segment are visitors of the city unlike other segments which are composed of locals.

We believe that this study could be used for rate optimization and further developed to explore applications on high variable income businesses, advertising, e-wallet companies, and most importantly, the transportation and urban planning of our very own Metro Manila.
